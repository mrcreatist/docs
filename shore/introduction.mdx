<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Imagine yourself as a captain of a ship and the ship has three holes one is very big. One is little big and one is small. You just go and check for the holes and you just imagine the solution and you become happy about thinking the solution you are not implementing the solution. Always remember, you are just thinking about the solution youâ€™re not implementing the solution. So take the biggest hole first and fix it then move onto the new.

- How to clear and concise in your communication

    **1. Know your audience.** Before you start speaking or writing, consider who you're communicating with. What is their level of knowledge about the topic? What are their interests? What is the purpose of your communication? Tailoring your message to your audience will help ensure that it is clear and relevant.

    **2. Focus on your main point.** What is the single most important thing you want your audience to take away from your communication? Once you know your main point, keep it at the forefront of your mind and make sure everything you say or write relates back to it.

    **3. Use simple language.** Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your audience may not understand. Stick to plain language that is easy to follow.

    **4. Be concise.** Get to the point quickly and avoid rambling. Every sentence you say or write should serve a purpose.

    **5. Use strong verbs.** Strong verbs make your writing more vivid and engaging. They also help to keep your sentences concise.

    **6. Break up your text.** Long paragraphs can be intimidating to read. Break up your text into shorter paragraphs to make it easier for your audience to digest.

    **7. Use bullet points and numbered lists.** Bullet points and numbered lists can help to break up your text and make it easier to scan. They can also be a helpful way to present complex information in a clear and concise way.

    **8. Proofread your work.** Before you send your communication, take some time to proofread it carefully. This will help to ensure that there are no typos or grammatical errors.

    **9. Get feedback.** Ask someone else to read or listen to your communication and give you feedback. This can help you to identify any areas where you can improve your clarity and conciseness.
