What are your commitments to her?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Complaints from her">
 - **You don’t take responsibilities**, that is true. I feel lethargic in resolving conflicts.
 - **I am more inclined towards my parents**, that is also true and I don’t know the reason for this as well, I think I associate myself with my parents and as she speaks against them, it tends to hit against me.
 - **I don’t help in household**, yes that’s true because I am a lethargic procrastinator. I get the feeling that she is working alone in the kitchen but I also get the feeling that I am comfortable and I have done office work too, the program/video I am watching is relevant and important to me and will provide knowledge for the future.

## My Observations
    1. She is not fun, but she thinks she is fun. Try to understand her fun
    2. She sometimes disregard the appreciation I am trying to give her, I feel discomfort then, like in the case of Apple TV.
    3. Whenever she correct me, I feel offended and try to do the same to her, which is very wrong. I speak out things randomly as they comes to my minds and when I am being corrected I feel offended. **Need to fix this.**
    4. I feel there is a mismatch in the level of understanding, I feel she is not putting much effort in the relationship, since I only think of new things to do together. **Need to fix this.**
    5. I am under confident in front of my parents, I am not able to speak much to them. **Need to fix this.**
    6. When I don't like the point other person is trying to prove, I tend to ignore it bluntly. Because I also have nothing to say.
    7. I start getting irritated once she says something I don’t like.
